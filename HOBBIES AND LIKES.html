                    <li  style="font-size: 20px;">I also love to write poems,shayaris.My favourite creation
                        of my own is " KAHANI HUN" and "MANN KI DUVIDHA BATATI NAHIN, HAAN MAIN JATATI NAHIN". 
                            I also like to take part in co-curricular activities like debate,speech,
                            photography(sometimes). Being from 'BRIJ', fascinated with "KANHA" and his shows/bhajans, 
                        may sound odd but ya it is true. So,these are somethings that I like.
