                <li style="font-size: 22px;margin-bottom: .8em;">A student portfolio is a compilation of academic work and other forms of educational evidence assembled
                     for the purpose of:
                     </li> 
                <li style="font-size: 20px;margin-bottom: .8em;">evaluating coursework quality, learning progress, and academic achievement; 
                    </li>
                <li style="font-size: 20px;margin-bottom: .8em;"> determining whether students have met learning standards or other academic requirements 
                     for courses,grade-level promotion, and graduation;
                    </li> 
                <li style="font-size: 20px;margin-bottom: .8em;">helping students reflect on their academic goals and progress
                       as learners; and
                     </li>
                <li style="font-size: 20px;margin-bottom: .8em;"> creating a lasting archive of academic work products, accomplishments, and other documentation.
                     Advocates of student portfolios argue that compiling, reviewing, and evaluating student
                     work over time can provide a richer, deeper, and more accurate picture of what students 
                     have learned and are able to do than more traditional measures—such as standardized tests, 
                    quizzes, or final exams—that only measure what students know at a specific point in time.
